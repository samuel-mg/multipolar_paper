# Code for the paper "Multipolar social systems: Measuring polarization beyond dichotomous contexts"

To reproduce the main results of the paper:
1. Decompress the "data" and "partial_results" files.
2. Go inside file "python" and run "python polarization_computations.py".

It is recommended to run the code in a computer with at least 64GB of RAM, although it has been successfully tested in a laptop with 16GB.

The required python modules are:
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scipy
- sympy
- time
- sys
- sklearn
- networkx
- pickle
- copy
- imp
- itertools
- multiprocessing
